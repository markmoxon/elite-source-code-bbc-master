\       Name: TVT3
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Screen mode
\    Summary: Palette data for the mode 1 part of the screen (the top part)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The following table contains four different mode 1 palettes, each of which
\ sets a four-colour palatte for the top part of the screen. Mode 1 supports
\ four colours on-screen and in Elite colour 0 is always set to black, so each
\ of the palettes in this table defines the three other colours (1 to 3).
\
\ There is some consistency between the palettes:
\
\   * Colour 0 is always black
\   * Colour 1 (#YELLOW) is always yellow
\   * Colour 2 (#RED) is normally red-like (i.e. red or magenta)
\              ... except in the title screen palette, when it is white
\   * Colour 3 (#CYAN) is always cyan-like (i.e. white or cyan)
\
\ The configuration variables of #YELLOW, #RED and #CYAN are a bit misleading,
\ but if you think of them in terms of hue rather than specific colours, they
\ work reasonably well (outside of the title screen palette, anyway).
\
\ The palettes are set in the IRQ1 handler that implements the split screen
\ mode, and can be changed by calling the SETVDU19 routine to set the offset to
\ the new palette in this table.
\
\ This table must start on a page boundary (i.e. an address that ends in two
\ zeroes in hexadecimal). In the release version of the game TVT3 is at &2C00.
\ This is so the SETVDU19 routine can switch palettes properly, as it does this
\ by overwriting the low byte of the palette data address with a new offset, so
\ the low byte for first palette's address must be 0.
\
\ Palette data is given as a set of bytes, with each byte mapping a logical
\ colour to a physical one. In each byte, the logical colour is given in bits
\ 4-7 and the physical colour in bits 0-3. See p.379 of the Advanced User Guide
\ for details of how palette mapping works, as in modes 1 and 2 we have to do
\ multiple palette commands to change the colours correctly, and the physical
\ colour value is EOR'd with 7, just to make things even more confusing.

\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Lookup table for converting pixel y-coordinate to page number of
\             screen address
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Elite's screen mode is based on mode 1, so it allocates two pages of screen
\ memory to each character row (where a character row is 8 pixels high). This
\ table enables us to convert a pixel y-coordinate in the range 0-247 into the
\ page number for the start of the character row containing that coordinate.
\
\ Screen memory is from &4000 to &7DFF, so the lookup works like this:

\   Y =   0 to  7,  lookup value = &40 (so row 1 is from &4000 to &41FF)
\   Y =   8 to 15,  lookup value = &42 (so row 2 is from &4200 to &43FF)
\   Y =  16 to 23,  lookup value = &44 (so row 3 is from &4400 to &45FF)
\   Y =  24 to 31,  lookup value = &46 (so row 4 is from &4600 to &47FF)
\
\   ...
\
\   Y = 232 to 239, lookup value = &7A (so row 31 is from &7A00 to &7BFF)
\   Y = 240 to 247, lookup value = &7C (so row 31 is from &7C00 to &7DFF)
\
\ There is also a lookup value for y-coordinates from 248 to 255, but that's off
\ the end of the screen, as the special Elite screen mode only has 31 character
\ rows.

\       Name: LOIN (Part 3 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a shallow line going right and up or left and down
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going right and up (no swap) or left and down (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 > Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a shallow line going right and down or left and up
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going right and down (no swap) or left and up (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 <= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\
\       Name: LOIN (Part 6 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and left or down and right
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and left (no swap) or down and right (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\       Name: LOIN (Part 7 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and right or down and left
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and right (no swap) or down and left (swap)
\
\   * X1 >= X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\   Category: Drawing pixels
\    Summary: Lookup table for 2-pixel mode 1 orange pixels for the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Blocks of orange (as used when drawing the sun) have alternate red and yellow
\ pixels in a cross-hatch pattern. The cross-hatch pattern is made up of offset
\ rows that are 2 pixels high, and it is made up of red and yellow rectangles,
\ each of which is 2 pixels high and 1 pixel wide. The result looks like this:
\
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...yryryryryryryryr...
\   ...yryryryryryryryr...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\
\ and so on, repeating every four pixel rows.
\
\ This is implemented with the following lookup table, where bits 0-1 of the
\ pixel y-coordinate are used as the index, to fetch the correct pattern to use.
\
\ Rows with y-coordinates ending in %00 or %01 fetch the red/yellow pattern from
\ the table, while rows with y-coordinates ending in %10 or %11 fetch the
\ yellow/red pattern, so the pattern repeats every four pixel rows.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called after the ships in the hanger have been drawn, so all
\ it has to do is draw the hanger's background.
\
\ The hanger background is made up of two parts:
\
\   * The hanger floor consists of 11 screen-wide horizontal lines, which start
\     out quite spaced out near the bottom of the screen, and bunch ever closer
\     together as the eye moves up towards the horizon, where they merge to give
\     a sense of perspective
\
\   * The back wall of the hanger consists of 15 equally spaced vertical lines
\     that join the horizon to the top of the screen
\
\ The ships in the hangar have already been drawn by this point, so the lines
\ are drawn so they don't overlap anything that's already there, which makes
\ them look like they are behind and below the ships. This is achieved by
\ drawing the lines in from the screen edges until they bump into something
\ already on-screen. For the horizontal lines, when there are multiple ships in
\ the hanger, this also means drawing lines between the ships, as well as in
\ from each side.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Print a character at the text cursor (XC, YC), do a beep, print a newline,
\ or delete left (backspace).
\
\ Calls to OSWRCH will end up here when A is not in the range 128-147, as those
\ are reserved for the special jump table OSWRCH commands.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The character to be printed. Can be one of the
\                       following:
\
\                         * 7 (beep)

\                           punctuation)
\
\                         * 127 (delete the character to the left of the text
\                           cursor and move the cursor to the left)
\
\   XC                  Contains the text column to print at (the x-coordinate)
\
\   YC                  Contains the line number to print on (the y-coordinate)
\
\ Returns:

\
\ Set A and X to the colours we should use for indicators showing dangerous and
\ safe values respectively. This enables us to implement flashing indicators,
\ which is one of the game's configurable options.
\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be
\ red for 8 iterations of the main loop, and green for the next 8, before
\ going back to red. If we always use PZW to decide which colours we should use
\ when updating indicators, flashing colours will be automatically taken care of
\ for us.
\
\ The values returned are #GREEN2 for green and #RED2 for red. These are mode 2
\ bytes that contain 2 pixels, with the colour of each pixel given in four bits.
\
\ Returns:

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Flight keys are logged in the key logger at location KY1 onwards, with a
\ non-zero value in the relevant location indicating a key press. See the deep
\ dive on "The key logger" for more details.
\
\ The key presses that are processed are as follows:
\
\   * SPACE and "?" to speed up and slow down
\   * "U", "T" and "M" to disarm, arm and fire missiles
\   * TAB to fire an energy bomb
\   * ESCAPE to launch an escape pod
\   * "J" to initiate an in-system jump
\   * "E" to deploy E.C.M. anti-missile countermeasures
\   * "C" to use the docking computer
\   * "A" to fire lasers

\
\ Draw a single segment of a circle, adding the point to the ball line heap.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   CNT                 The number of this segment
\
\   STP                 The step size for the circle
\
\   K6(1 0)             The x-coordinate of the new point on the circle, as
\                       a screen coordinate
\
\   (T X)               The y-coordinate of the new point on the circle, as
\                       an offset from the centre of the circle
\
\   FLAG                Set to &FF for the first call, so it sets up the first
\                       point in the heap but waits until the second call before
\                       drawing anything (as we need two points, i.e. two calls,
\                       before we can draw a line)
\
\   K                   The circle's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             Pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the circle
\
\   K4(1 0)             Pixel y-coordinate of the centre of the circle
\
\   SWAP                If non-zero, we swap (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   CNT                 CNT is updated to CNT + STP
\
\   A                   The new value of CNT
\
\   FLAG                Set to 0

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ See STARS1 for an explanation of the maths used in this routine. The
\ calculations are as follows:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. x = x - |x_hi| * q
\   3. y = y - |y_hi| * q
\   4. z = z + speed * 64
\
\   5. y = y - alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x + alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x - 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y + beta * 256

\ Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
\ an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
\ coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
\ arguments X and Y.
\
\ In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
\ following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:

\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
\
\ as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
\ the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
\                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)

\
\ Given a value in Y that points to the start of a ship data block as an offset
\ from K%, calculate the following:
\
\   A = A OR x_sign OR y_sign OR z_sign
\
\ and clear the sign bit of the result. The K% workspace contains the ship data
\ blocks, so the offset in Y must be 0 or a multiple of NI% (as each block in

\ might not be one of the three input values - it's just guaranteed to be
\ larger than all of them).
\
\ If Y = 0 and A = 0, then this calculates the maximum cap of the highest byte
\ containing the distance to the planet, as K%+2 = x_sign, K%+5 = y_sign and
\ K%+8 = z_sign (the first slot in the K% workspace represents the planet).

\ from K%, calculate the following:
\
\   A = x_hi^2 + y_hi^2 + z_hi^2
\
\ returning A = &FF if the calculation overflows a one-byte result. The K%
\ workspace contains the ship data blocks, so the offset in Y must be 0 or a
\ multiple of NI% (as each block in K% contains NI% bytes).
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The offset from K% for the start of the ship data block
\                       to use
\
\ Returns
\
\   A                   A = x_hi^2 + y_hi^2 + z_hi^2
\
\                       A = &FF if the calculation overflows a one-byte result

\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16
\
\ Arguments:
\

\
\                         * If X = 15, rotate roofv_x
\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 25, rotate sidev_z

\                       or negative (i.e. the sign of the roll or pitch counter

\ See the deep dive on "Printing decimal numbers" for details of the algorithm
\ used in this routine.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K(0 1 2 3)          The number to print, stored with the most significant
\                       byte in K and the least significant in K+3 (i.e. as a
\                       big-endian number, which is the opposite way to how the
\                       6502 assembler stores addresses, for example)
\
\   U                   The maximum number of digits to print, including the
\                       decimal point (spaces will be used on the left to pad
\                       out the result to this width, so the number is right-
\                       aligned to this width). U must be 11 or less
\
\   C flag              If set, include a decimal point followed by one
\                       fractional digit (i.e. show the number to 1 decimal
\                       place). In this case, the number in K(0 1 2 3) contains
\                       10 * the number we end up printing, so to print 123.4,
\                       we would pass 1234 in K(0 1 2 3) and would set the C
\                       flag to include the decimal point

\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00100000 = apply lower case to the second letter of a word onwards
\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence
\ case}, which calls routine MT2 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is used to indicate whether standard or extended text tokens
\ should be printed by calls to DETOK. It allows us to mix standard tokens in
\ with extended tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00000000 = print extended tokens (i.e. those in TKN1 and RUTOK)
\
\   * %11111111 = print standard tokens (i.e. those in QQ18)
\
\ The default value is %00000000 (extended tokens).
\
\ Standard tokens are set by jump token {6}, which calls routine MT6 to change
\ the value of DTW3 to %11111111.
\
\ Extended tokens are set by jump token {5}, which calls routine MT5 to change
\ the value of DTW3 to %00000000.

\
\ This variable is used to control how justified text tokens are printed as part
\ of the extended text token system. There are two bits that affect justified
\ text:
\
\   * Bit 7: 1 = justify text
\            0 = do not justify text
\
\   * Bit 6: 1 = buffer the entire token before printing, including carriage
\                returns (used for in-flight messages only)
\            0 = print the contents of the buffer whenever a carriage return
\                appears in the token
\
\ The default value is %00000000 (do not justify text, print buffer on carriage
\ return).
\
\ The flag is set to %10000000 (justify text, print buffer on carriage return)

\  Deep dive: Extended text tokens
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is only used by one specific extended token, the {single cap}
\ jump token, which capitalises the next letter only. It has two values:
\
\   * %11011111 = capitalise the next letter
\
\   * %11111111 = do not change case
\
\ The default value is %11111111 (do not change case).
\
\ The flag is set to %11011111 (capitalise the next letter) by jump token 19,
\ {single cap}, which calls routine MT19 to change the value of DTW.
\
\ The flag is set to %11111111 (do not change case) at the start of DASC, after
\ the letter has been capitalised in DETOK2, so the effect is to capitalise one
\ letter only.
\
\ The letter to print is AND'd with DTW8 in DETOK2, which capitalises the letter
\ by clearing bit 5 (if DTW8 is %11011111). However, this AND is only done if at
\ least one of the following is true:
\
\   * Bit 7 of DTW2 is set (we are not currently printing a word)
\
\   * Bit 7 of DTW6 is set (lower case has been enabled by jump token 13, {lower
\     case}
\
\ In other words, we only capitalise the next letter if it's the first letter in
\ a word, or we are printing in lower case.

\ HATB, and half the time this will draw a solitary Sidewinder, Mamba, Krait or
\ Adder on a random position. In all cases, the ships will be randomly spun
\ around on the ground so they can face in any dirction, and larger ships are
\ drawn higher up off the ground than smaller ships.
\
\ The ships are drawn by the HAS1 routine, which uses the normal ship-drawing
\ routine in LL9, and then the hanger background is drawn by sending an OSWORD
\ 248 command to the I/O processor.

\    Summary: Draw a ship in the ship hanger
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The ship's position within the hanger is determined by the arguments and the
\ size of the ship's targetable area, as follows:
\
\   * The x-coordinate is (x_sign x_hi 0) from the arguments, so the ship can be
\     left of centre or right of centre
\
\   * The y-coordinate is negative and is lower down the screen for smaller
\     ships, so smaller ships are drawn closer to the ground (because they are)
\
\   * The z-coordinate is positive, with both z_hi (which is 1 or 2) and z_lo
\     coming from the arguments
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   XX15                Bits 0-7 = Ship's z_lo
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's x_sign
\
\   XX15+1              Bits 0-7 = Ship's x_hi
\                       Bit 0    = Ship's z_hi (1 if clear, or 2 if set)
\

\ This part does the following:
\
\   * If this is a missile, jump up to the missile code in part 1
\
\   * If this is the space station and it is hostile, consider spawning a cop
\     (6.2% chance, up to a maximum of seven) and we're done

\
\   * If this is a rock hermit, consider spawning (22% chance) a highly

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the dot product of the vector in XX15 and one of the space station's
\ orientation vectors, as determined by the value of Y. If vect is the space
\ station orientation vector, we calculate this:

\
\ Technically speaking, this routine can also calculate the dot product between
\ XX15 and the sun's orientation vectors, as the sun and space station share the
\ same ship data slot (the second ship data block at K%). However, the sun
\ doesn't have orientation vectors, so this only gets called when that slot is
\ being used for the space station.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The space station's orientation vector:

\    Summary: Calculate the vector from the ideal docking position to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called by the docking computer routine in DOCKIT. It works out
\ the vector between the ship and the ideal docking position, which is straight
\ in front of the docking slot, but some distance away.
\
\ Specifically, it calculates the following:
\
\   * K3(2 1 0) = K3(2 1 0) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(5 4 3) = K3(5 4 3) - nosev_y_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(8 7 6) = K3(8 7 6) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\ where K3 is the vector from the station to the ship, and nosev is the nose
\ vector for the space station.
\
\ The nose vector points from the centre of the station through the slot, so
\ -nosev * 4 is the vector from a point in front of the docking slot, but some
\ way from the station, back to the centre of the station. Adding this to the
\ vector from the station to the ship gives the vector from the point in front
\ of the station to the ship.
\
\ In practice, this routine is called twice, so the ideal docking position is
\ actually at a distance of 8 unit vectors from the centre of the station.
\
\ Back in DOCKIT, we flip this vector round to get the vector from the ship to
\ the point in front of the station slot.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the station to the ship
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the ship to the ideal docking position
\                       (4 unit vectors from the centre of the station for each
\                       call to DCS1, so two calls will return the vector to a

\    Summary: Draw the launch or hyperspace tunnel
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the
\ centre, and then double the radius, draw another circle, double the radius
\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger
\ than 160 (which goes beyond the edge of the screen, which is 256 pixels wide,
\ equivalent to a radius of 128). We then repeat this whole process for an
\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.
\
\ This has the effect of making the tunnel appear to be racing towards us as we
\ hurtle out into hyperspace or through the space station's docking tunnel.
\
\ The hyperspace effect is done in a full mode 2 screen, which makes the rings
\ all coloured and zig-zaggy, while the launch screen is in the normal
\ four-colour mode 1 screen.

\
\ Calculate the following division and remainder:
\
\   P = DELTA / (the Y-th stardust particle's z_hi coordinate)
\
\   R = remainder as a fraction of A, where 1.0 = 255
\
\ Another way of saying the above is this:
\
\   (P R) = 256 * DELTA / z_hi
\
\ DELTA is a value between 1 and 40, and the minimum z_hi is 16 (dust particles
\ are removed at lower values than this), so this means P is between 0 and 2
\ (as 40 / 16 = 2.5, so the maximum result is P = 2 and R = 128.
\
\ This uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm as TIS2, but this time we
\ keep the remainder.

\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0) = (A P+1 P) / (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ The actual division here is done as an 8-bit calculation using LL31, but this
\ routine shifts both the numerator (the top part of the division) and the
\ denominator (the bottom part of the division) around to get the multi-byte
\ result we want.
\
\ Specifically, it shifts both of them to the left as far as possible, keeping a
\ tally of how many shifts get done in each one - and specifically, the
\ difference in the number of shifts between the top and bottom (as shifting
\ both of them once in the same direction won't change the result). It then
\ divides the two highest bytes with the simple 8-bit routine in LL31, and
\ shifts the result by the difference in the number of shifts, which acts as a
\ scale factor to get the correct result.

\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant

\ 16-bit seeds in QQ15 (using only s0_hi, s1_hi and s1_lo):
\
\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when
\ the system data gets displayed, so they aren't calculated here.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine works its way through the recursive tokens that are stored in
\ tokenised form in memory at &0400 to &06FF, and when it finds token number A,
\ it prints it. Tokens are null-terminated in memory and fill three pages,
\ but there is no lookup table as that would consume too much memory, so the
\ only way to find the correct token is to start at the beginning and look
\ through the table byte by byte, counting tokens as we go until we are in the
\ right place. This approach might not be terribly speed efficient, but it is
\ certainly memory-efficient.
\
\ For details of the tokenisation system, see variable QQ18.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The recursive token to be printed, in the range 0-148

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Project the current ship's location onto the screen, either returning the
\ screen coordinates of the projection (if it's on-screen), or returning an
\ error via the C flag.
\
\ In this context, "on-screen" means that the point is projected into the
\ following range:
\
\   centre of screen - 1024 < x < centre of screen + 1024
\   centre of screen - 1024 < y < centre of screen + 1024
\
\ This is to cater for ships (and, more likely, planets and suns) whose centres
\ are off-screen but whose edges may still be visible.
\
\ The projection calculation is:

\   K3(1 0) = #X + x / z
\   K4(1 0) = #Y + y / z

\
\ Calculate the following division of a specified value from one of the

\   (Y A) = nosev_x / z

\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 9, 11, 13: divides nosev_x, nosev_y, nosev_z
\
\                         * X = 15, 17, 19: divides roofv_x, roofv_y, roofv_z

\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following, with X determining the vector to use:
\
\   (Y A P) = 222 * roofv_x / z
\
\ though in reality only (Y A) is used.
\
\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the
\ routine is only called with X = 15, and then again after X has been
\ incremented to 17. So the values calculated by PLS1 use roofv_x first, then
\ roofv_y. The comments below refer to roofv_x, for the first call.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   Determines which of the INWK orientation vectors to
\                       divide:
\
\                         * X = 15: divides roofv_x
\
\                         * X = 17: divides roofv_y
\
\ Returns:
\
\   X                   X gets incremented by 2 so it points to the next
\                       coordinate in this orientation vector (so consecutive
\                       calls to the routine will start with x, then move onto y

\   Category: Universe
\    Summary: Remove a ship from our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Remove the ship in slot X from our local bubble of universe. This happens
\ when we kill a ship, collide with a ship and destroy it, or when a ship moves
\ outside our local bubble.
\
\ We also use this routine when we move out of range of the space station, in
\ which case we replace it with the sun.
\
\ When removing a ship, this creates a gap in the ship slots at FRIN, so we
\ shuffle all the later slots down to close the gap. We also shuffle the ship
\ data blocks at K% and ship line heap at WP, to reclaim all the memory that
\ the removed ship used to occupy.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The slot number of the ship to remove
\
\   XX0                 The address of the blueprint for the ship to remove
\
\   INF                 The address of the data block for the ship to remove

\       Name: BRBR
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Utility routines
\    Summary: The standard BRKV handler for the game
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is used to display error messages, before restarting the game.
\ When called, it makes a beep and prints the system error message in the block
\ pointed to by (&FD &FE), which is where the MOS will put any system errors. It
\ then waits for a key press and restarts the game.
\
\ BRKV is set to this routine in the decryption routine at DEEOR just before the
\ game is run for the first time, and at the end of the SVE routine after the
\ disc access menu has been processed. In other words, this is the standard
\ BRKV handler for the game, and it's swapped out to MRBRK for disc access
\ operations only.
\
\ When it is the BRKV handler, the routine can be triggered using a BRK
\ instruction. The main differences between this routine and the MEBRK handler
\ that is used during disc access operations are that this routine restarts the
\ game rather than returning to the disc access menu, and this handler
\ decrements the brkd counter.

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3(2 1 0)           The 16-bit x-coordinate as (x_sign x_hi x_lo), where
\                       x_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7
\
\ Returns:
\
\   XX15                The normalised vector, with:
\
\                         * The x-coordinate in XX15

\       Name: DKS3
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Keyboard
\    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (&40)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (&41)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (&42)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (&43)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (&44)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (&45)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (&46)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the internal key numbers (see p.142 of the
\ Advanced User Guide for a list of internal key numbers). We pass the key that
\ has been pressed in X, and the configuration option to check it against in Y,
\ so this routine is typically called in a loop that loops through the various
\ configuration options.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The internal number of the key that's been pressed
\
\   Y                   The internal number of the configuration key to check
\                       against, from the list above (i.e. Y must be from &40 to
\                       &46)

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Scan for the seven primary flight controls (or the equivalent on joystick),
\ pause and configuration keys, and secondary flight controls, and update the
\ key logger accordingly. Specifically:
\
\   * If we are on keyboard configuration, clear the key logger and update it
\     for the seven primary flight controls, and update the pitch and roll
\     rates accordingly.
\
\   * If we are on joystick configuration, clear the key logger and jump to
\     DKJ1, which reads the joystick equivalents of the primary flight
\     controls.
\
\ Both options end up at DK4 to scan for other keys, beyond the seven primary
\ flight controls.

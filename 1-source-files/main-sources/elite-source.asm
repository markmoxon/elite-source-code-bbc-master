\       Name: TVT3
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Drawing the screen
\    Summary: Palette data for the mode 1 part of the screen (the top part)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The following table contains four different mode 1 palettes, each of which
\ sets a four-colour palette for the top part of the screen. Mode 1 supports
\ four colours on-screen and in Elite colour 0 is always set to black, so each
\ of the palettes in this table defines the three other colours (1 to 3).
\
\ There is some consistency between the palettes:
\
\   * Colour 0 is always black
\   * Colour 1 (#YELLOW) is always yellow
\   * Colour 2 (#RED) is normally red-like (i.e. red or magenta)
\              ... except in the title screen palette, when it is white
\   * Colour 3 (#CYAN) is always cyan-like (i.e. white or cyan)
\
\ The configuration variables of #YELLOW, #RED and #CYAN are a bit misleading,
\ but if you think of them in terms of hue rather than specific colours, they
\ work reasonably well (outside of the title screen palette, anyway).
\
\ The palettes are set in the IRQ1 handler that implements the split screen
\ mode, and can be changed by calling the SETVDU19 routine to set the offset to
\ the new palette in this table.
\
\ This table must start on a page boundary (i.e. an address that ends in two
\ zeroes in hexadecimal). In the release version of the game TVT3 is at &2C00.
\ This is so the SETVDU19 routine can switch palettes properly, as it does this
\ by overwriting the low byte of the palette data address with a new offset, so
\ the low byte for first palette's address must be 0.
\
\ Palette data is given as a set of bytes, with each byte mapping a logical
\ colour to a physical one. In each byte, the logical colour is given in bits
\ 4-7 and the physical colour in bits 0-3. See p.379 of the Advanced User Guide
\ for details of how palette mapping works, as in modes 1 and 2 we have to do
\ multiple palette commands to change the colours correctly, and the physical
\ colour value is EOR'd with 7, just to make things even more confusing.

\    Summary: Lookup table for converting pixel y-coordinate to page number of
\             screen address
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Elite's screen mode is based on mode 1, so it allocates two pages of screen
\ memory to each character row (where a character row is 8 pixels high). This
\ table enables us to convert a pixel y-coordinate in the range 0-247 into the
\ page number for the start of the character row containing that coordinate.
\
\ Screen memory is from &4000 to &7DFF, so the lookup works like this:
\
\   Y =   0 to  7,  lookup value = &40 (so row 1 is from &4000 to &41FF)
\   Y =   8 to 15,  lookup value = &42 (so row 2 is from &4200 to &43FF)
\   Y =  16 to 23,  lookup value = &44 (so row 3 is from &4400 to &45FF)
\   Y =  24 to 31,  lookup value = &46 (so row 4 is from &4600 to &47FF)
\
\   ...
\
\   Y = 232 to 239, lookup value = &7A (so row 31 is from &7A00 to &7BFF)
\   Y = 240 to 247, lookup value = &7C (so row 32 is from &7C00 to &7DFF)
\
\ There is also a lookup value for y-coordinates from 248 to 255, but that's off
\ the end of the screen, as the special Elite screen mode only has 31 character
\ rows.

\
\ Ready-made bytes for plotting one-pixel points in mode 2 (the bottom part of

\
\ In mode 2, each character row is one byte, which is two pixels. Rows 0 and 1

\ while rows 2 and 3 contain a character row byte with just the right pixel
\ plotted.
\
\ In other words, looking up row X will return a character row byte with pixel
\ X/2 plotted (if the pixels are numbered 0 and 1).
\
\ There are two extra rows to support the use of CTWOS+2,X indexing in the CPIX2
\ routine. The extra rows are repeats of the first two rows, and save us from
\ having to work out whether CTWOS+2+X needs to be wrapped around when drawing a
\ two-pixel dash that crosses from one character block into another. See CPIX2

\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a shallow line going right and up or left and down
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going right and up (no swap) or left and down (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 > Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right, omitting the
\     first pixel
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and left or down and right
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and left (no swap) or down and right (swap)
\
\   * X1 < X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at top left to (X2, Y2) at bottom right, omitting the
\     first pixel
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\       Name: LOIN (Part 7 of 7)
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a steep line going up and right or down and left
\  Deep dive: Bresenham's line algorithm
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine draws a line from (X1, Y1) to (X2, Y2). It has multiple stages.
\ If we get here, then:
\
\   * The line is going up and right (no swap) or down and left (swap)
\
\   * X1 >= X2 and Y1 >= Y2
\
\   * Draw from (X1, Y1) at bottom left to (X2, Y2) at top right, omitting the
\     first pixel
\
\ This routine looks complex, but that's because the loop that's used in the
\ cassette and disc versions has been unrolled to speed it up. The algorithm is
\ unchanged, it's just a lot longer.

\    Summary: Lookup table for 2-pixel mode 1 orange pixels for the sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Blocks of orange (as used when drawing the sun) have alternate red and yellow
\ pixels in a cross-hatch pattern. The cross-hatch pattern is made up of offset
\ rows that are 2 pixels high, and it is made up of red and yellow rectangles,
\ each of which is 2 pixels high and 1 pixel wide. The result looks like this:
\
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...yryryryryryryryr...
\   ...yryryryryryryryr...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\   ...ryryryryryryryry...
\
\ and so on, repeating every four pixel rows.
\
\ This is implemented with the following lookup table, where bits 0-1 of the
\ pixel y-coordinate are used as the index, to fetch the correct pattern to use.
\
\ Rows with y-coordinates ending in %00 or %01 fetch the red/yellow pattern from
\ the table, while rows with y-coordinates ending in %10 or %11 fetch the
\ yellow/red pattern, so the pattern repeats every four pixel rows.

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called after the ships in the hangar have been drawn, so all
\ it has to do is draw the hangar's background.
\
\ The hangar background is made up of two parts:
\
\   * The hangar floor consists of 11 screen-wide horizontal lines, which start
\     out quite spaced out near the bottom of the screen, and bunch ever closer
\     together as the eye moves up towards the horizon, where they merge to give
\     a sense of perspective
\
\   * The back wall of the hangar consists of 15 equally spaced vertical lines
\     that join the horizon to the top of the screen
\
\ The ships in the hangar have already been drawn by this point, so the lines
\ are drawn so they don't overlap anything that's already there, which makes
\ them look like they are behind and below the ships. This is achieved by
\ drawing the lines in from the screen edges until they bump into something
\ already on-screen. For the horizontal lines, when there are multiple ships in
\ the hangar, this also means drawing lines between the ships, as well as in
\ from each side.

\
\ Calculate the following division and remainder:
\
\   P = A / Q
\
\   R = remainder as a fraction of Q, where 1.0 = 255
\
\ Another way of saying the above is this:
\
\   (P R) = 256 * A / Q
\
\ This uses the same shift-and-subtract algorithm as TIS2, but this time we
\ keep the remainder.

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The character to be printed. Can be one of the
\                       following:
\
\                         * 7 (beep)

\                           punctuation)
\
\                         * 127 (delete the character to the left of the text
\                           cursor and move the cursor to the left)
\
\   XC                  Contains the text column to print at (the x-coordinate)
\
\   YC                  Contains the line number to print on (the y-coordinate)

\
\ If flashing is enabled, the colour returned in A (dangerous values) will be

\ in the rightmost).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The offset of the vertical bar to show in the indicator,
\                       from 0 at the far left, to 8 in the middle, and 15 at
\                       the far right
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              The C flag is set

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Calculate the alpha and beta angles from the current pitch and roll
\
\ Here we take the current rate of pitch and roll, as set by the joystick or
\ keyboard, and convert them into alpha and beta angles that we can use in the
\ matrix functions to rotate space around our ship. The alpha angle covers
\ roll, while the beta angle covers pitch (there is no yaw in this version of
\ Elite). The angles are in radians, which allows us to use the small angle
\ approximation when moving objects in the sky (see the MVEIT routine for more
\ on this). Also, the signs of the two angles are stored separately, in both
\ the sign and the flipped sign, as this makes calculations easier.

\
\ The main flight loop covers most of the flight-specific aspects of Elite. This
\ section covers the following:
\
\   * Scan for flight keys and process the results
\
\ Flight keys are logged in the key logger at location KY1 onwards, with a
\ non-zero value in the relevant location indicating a key press. See the deep
\ dive on "The key logger" for more details.
\
\ The key presses that are processed are as follows:
\
\   * Space and "?" to speed up and slow down
\   * "U", "T" and "M" to disarm, arm and fire missiles
\   * TAB to fire an energy bomb
\   * ESCAPE to launch an escape pod
\   * "J" to initiate an in-system jump
\   * "E" to deploy E.C.M. anti-missile countermeasures
\   * "C" to use the docking computer
\   * "A" to fire lasers

\       Name: STARS6
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Stardust
\    Summary: Process the stardust for the rear view
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is very similar to STARS1, which processes stardust for the front
\ view. The main difference is that the direction of travel is reversed, so the
\ signs in the calculations are different, as well as the order of the first
\ batch of calculations.
\
\ When a stardust particle falls away into the far distance, it is removed from
\ the screen and its memory is recycled as a new particle, positioned randomly
\ along one of the four edges of the screen.
\
\ These are the calculations referred to in the commentary:
\
\   1. q = 64 * speed / z_hi
\   2. z = z - speed * 64
\   3. y = y + |y_hi| * q
\   4. x = x + |x_hi| * q
\
\   5. y = y + alpha * x / 256
\   6. x = x - alpha * y / 256
\
\   7. x = x + 2 * (beta * y / 256) ^ 2
\   8. y = y - beta * 256
\

\       Name: MAS1
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Maths (Geometry)
\    Summary: Add an orientation vector coordinate to an INWK coordinate
\  Deep dive: The space station safe zone
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add a doubled nosev vector coordinate, e.g. (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2, to
\ an INWK coordinate, e.g. (x_sign x_hi x_lo), storing the result in the INWK
\ coordinate. The axes used in each side of the addition are specified by the
\ arguments X and Y.
\
\ In the comments below, we document the routine as if we are doing the
\ following, i.e. if X = 0 and Y = 11:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo) * 2
\
\ as that way the variable names in the comments contain "x" and "y" to match
\ the registers that specify the vector axis to use.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   X                   The coordinate to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If X = 0, add (x_sign x_hi x_lo)
\                         * If X = 3, add (y_sign y_hi y_lo)
\                         * If X = 6, add (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\   Y                   The vector to add, as follows:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  add (nosev_x_hi nosev_x_lo)
\                         * If Y = 11, add (nosev_y_hi nosev_y_lo)
\                         * If Y = 13, add (nosev_z_hi nosev_z_lo)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   The highest byte of the result with the sign cleared
\                       (e.g. |x_sign| when X = 0, etc.)

\    Summary: Calculate a cap on the maximum distance to the planet or sun
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Given a value in Y that points to the start of a ship data block as an offset
\ from K%, calculate the following:
\
\   A = A OR x_sign OR y_sign OR z_sign
\
\ and clear the sign bit of the result. The K% workspace contains the ship data
\ blocks, so the offset in Y must be 0 or a multiple of NI% (as each block in
\ K% contains NI% bytes).
\
\ The result effectively contains a maximum cap of the three values (though it
\ might not be one of the three input values - it's just guaranteed to be
\ larger than all of them).
\
\ If Y = 0 and A = 0, then this calculates the maximum cap of the highest byte
\ containing the distance to the planet, as K%+2 = x_sign, K%+5 = y_sign and
\ K%+8 = z_sign (the first slot in the K% workspace represents the planet).
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The offset from K% for the start of the ship data block
\                       to use
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   A                   A OR K%+2+Y OR K%+5+Y OR K%+8+Y, with bit 7 cleared
\

\  Deep dive: Orientation vectors
\             Pitching and rolling by a fixed angle
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Pitch or roll a ship by a small, fixed amount (1/16 radians, or 3.6 degrees),
\ in a specified direction, by rotating the orientation vectors. The vectors to
\ rotate are given in X and Y, and the direction of the rotation is given in
\ RAT2. The calculation is as follows:
\
\   * If the direction is positive:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) + Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) - X / 16
\
\   * If the direction is negative:
\
\     X = X * (1 - 1/512) - Y / 16
\     Y = Y * (1 - 1/512) + X / 16
\
\ So if X = 15 (roofv_x), Y = 21 (sidev_x) and RAT2 is positive, it does this:
\
\   roofv_x = roofv_x * (1 - 1/512)  + sidev_x / 16
\   sidev_x = sidev_x * (1 - 1/512)  - roofv_x / 16

\

\
\                         * If X = 17, rotate roofv_y
\
\                         * If X = 19, rotate roofv_z
\
\                         * If X = 21, rotate sidev_x

\                         * If X = 23, rotate sidev_y
\
\                         * If X = 25, rotate sidev_z
\
\   Y                   The second vector to rotate:
\
\                         * If Y = 9,  rotate nosev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 11, rotate nosev_y
\
\                         * If Y = 13, rotate nosev_z
\
\                         * If Y = 21, rotate sidev_x
\
\                         * If Y = 23, rotate sidev_y

\                       6502 assembler stores addresses, for example)
\
\   U                   The maximum number of digits to print, including the
\                       decimal point (spaces will be used on the left to pad
\                       out the result to this width, so the number is right-
\                       aligned to this width). U must be 11 or less
\
\   C flag              If set, include a decimal point followed by one
\                       fractional digit (i.e. show the number to 1 decimal
\                       place). In this case, the number in K(0 1 2 3) contains
\                       10 * the number we end up printing, so to print 123.4,
\                       we would pass 1234 in K(0 1 2 3) and would set the C
\                       flag to include the decimal point

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This variable is used to change characters to lower case as part of applying
\ Sentence Case to extended text tokens. It has two values:
\
\   * %00100000 = apply lower case to the second letter of a word onwards
\
\   * %00000000 = do not change case to lower case
\
\ The default value is %00100000 (apply lower case).
\
\ The flag is set to %00100000 (apply lower case) by jump token 2, {sentence
\ case}, which calls routine MT2 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The flag is set to %00000000 (do not change case to lower case) by jump token
\ 1, {all caps}, which calls routine MT1 to change the value of DTW1.
\
\ The letter to print is OR'd with DTW1 in DETOK2, which lower-cases the letter
\ by setting bit 5 (if DTW1 is %00100000). However, this OR is only done if bit
\ 7 of DTW2 is clear, i.e. we are printing a word, so this doesn't affect the
\ first letter of the word, which remains capitalised.

\   * %11011111 = capitalise the next letter
\

\
\ This section implements missile tactics and is entered at TA18 from the main
\ entry point below, if the current ship is a missile. Specifically:
\
\   * If E.C.M. is active, destroy the missile
\
\   * If the missile is hostile towards us, then check how close it is. If it
\     hasn't reached us, jump to part 3 so it can streak towards us, otherwise
\     we've been hit, so process a large amount of damage to our ship
\
\   * Otherwise see how close the missile is to its target. If it has not yet
\     reached its target, give the target a chance to activate its E.C.M. if it
\     has one, otherwise jump to TA19 with K3 set to the vector from the target
\     to the missile
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is the space station, destroy
\     the missile, potentially damaging us if we are nearby
\
\   * If it has reached its target and the target is a ship, destroy the missile
\     and the ship, potentially damaging us if we are nearby

\    Summary: Apply tactics: Calculate dot product to determine ship's aim
\  Deep dive: Program flow of the tactics routine
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This section sets up some vectors and calculates dot products. Specifically:
\
\   * If this is a lone Thargon without a mothership, set it adrift aimlessly
\     and we're done
\
\   * If this is a trader, 80% of the time we're done, 20% of the time the
\     trader performs the same checks as the bounty hunter
\
\   * If this is a bounty hunter (or one of the 20% of traders) and we have been
\     really bad (i.e. a fugitive or serious offender), the ship becomes hostile
\     (if it isn't already)
\
\   * If the ship is not hostile, then either perform docking manoeuvres (if
\     it's docking) or fly towards the planet (if it isn't docking) and we're
\     done
\
\   * If the ship is hostile, and a pirate, and we are within the space station
\     safe zone, stop the pirate from attacking by removing all its aggression
\
\   * Calculate the dot product of the ship's nose vector (i.e. the direction it
\     is pointing) with the vector between us and the ship. This value will help
\     us work out later on whether the enemy ship is pointing towards us, and
\     therefore whether it can hit us with its lasers.

\
\ This section looks at manoeuvring the ship. Specifically:
\
\   * Work out which direction the ship should be moving, depending on the type
\     of ship, where it is, which direction it is pointing, and how aggressive
\     it is
\
\   * Set the pitch and roll counters to head in that direction
\
\   * Speed up or slow down, depending on where the ship is in relation to us

\    Summary: Calculate the dot product of XX15 and one of the space station's
\             orientation vectors
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the dot product of the vector in XX15 and one of the space station's
\ orientation vectors, as determined by the value of Y. If vect is the space
\ station orientation vector, we calculate this:
\
\   (A X) = vect . XX15
\         = vect_x * XX15 + vect_y * XX15+1 + vect_z * XX15+2
\
\ Technically speaking, this routine can also calculate the dot product between
\ XX15 and the sun's orientation vectors, as the sun and space station share the
\ same ship data slot (the second ship data block at K%). However, the sun
\ doesn't have orientation vectors, so this only gets called when that slot is
\ being used for the space station.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   Y                   The space station's orientation vector:
\
\                         * If Y = 10, calculate nosev . XX15
\
\                         * If Y = 16, calculate roofv . XX15
\
\                         * If Y = 22, calculate sidev . XX15

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Flight
\    Summary: Calculate the vector from the ideal docking position to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine is called by the docking computer routine in DOCKIT. It works out
\ the vector between the ship and the ideal docking position, which is straight
\ in front of the docking slot, but some distance away.
\
\ Specifically, it calculates the following:
\
\   * K3(2 1 0) = K3(2 1 0) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(5 4 3) = K3(5 4 3) - nosev_y_hi * 4
\
\   * K3(8 7 6) = K3(8 7 6) - nosev_x_hi * 4
\
\ where K3 is the vector from the station to the ship, and nosev is the nose
\ vector for the space station.
\
\ The nose vector points from the centre of the station through the slot, so
\ -nosev * 4 is the vector from a point in front of the docking slot, but some
\ way from the station, back to the centre of the station. Adding this to the
\ vector from the station to the ship gives the vector from the point in front
\ of the station to the ship.
\
\ In practice, this routine is called twice, so the ideal docking position is
\ actually at a distance of 8 unit vectors from the centre of the station.
\
\ Back in DOCKIT, we flip this vector round to get the vector from the ship to
\ the point in front of the station slot.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the station to the ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K3                  The vector from the ship to the ideal docking position
\                       (4 unit vectors from the centre of the station for each
\                       call to DCS1, so two calls will return the vector to a
\                       point that's 8 unit vectors from the centre of the

\   Category: Drawing circles
\    Summary: Draw the launch or hyperspace tunnel
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The animation gets drawn like this. First, we draw a circle of radius 8 at the
\ centre, and then double the radius, draw another circle, double the radius
\ again and draw a circle, and we keep doing this until the radius is bigger
\ than 160 (which goes beyond the edge of the screen, which is 256 pixels wide,
\ equivalent to a radius of 128). We then repeat this whole process for an
\ initial circle of radius 9, then radius 10, all the way up to radius 15.
\
\ This has the effect of making the tunnel appear to be racing towards us as we
\ hurtle out into hyperspace or through the space station's docking tunnel.
\
\ The hyperspace effect is done in a full mode 2 screen, which makes the rings
\ all coloured and zig-zaggy, while the launch screen is in the normal
\ four-colour mode 1 screen.

\  Deep dive: Shift-and-add multiplication
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Do the following multiplication of an unsigned 16-bit number and an unsigned
\ 8-bit number:
\
\   (A P+1 P) = (A ~P) * Q
\
\ where ~P means P EOR %11111111 (i.e. P with all its bits flipped). In other
\ words, if you wanted to calculate &1234 * &56, you would:
\
\   * Set A to &12
\   * Set P to &34 EOR %11111111 = &CB
\   * Set Q to &56
\
\ before calling MLTU2.
\
\ This routine is like a mash-up of MU11 and FMLTU. It uses part of FMLTU's
\ inverted argument trick to work out whether or not to do an addition, and like
\ MU11 it sets up a counter in X to extract bits from (P+1 P). But this time we
\ extract 16 bits from (P+1 P), so the result is a 24-bit number. The core of
\ the algorithm is still the shift-and-add approach explained in MULT1, just

\    Summary: Calculate K(3 2 1 0) = (A P+1 P) / (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\  Deep dive: Shift-and-subtract division
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0) = (A P+1 P) / (z_sign z_hi z_lo)
\
\ The actual division here is done as an 8-bit calculation using LL31, but this
\ routine shifts both the numerator (the top part of the division) and the
\ denominator (the bottom part of the division) around to get the multi-byte
\ result we want.
\
\ Specifically, it shifts both of them to the left as far as possible, keeping a
\ tally of how many shifts get done in each one - and specifically, the
\ difference in the number of shifts between the top and bottom (as shifting
\ both of them once in the same direction won't change the result). It then
\ divides the two highest bytes with the simple 8-bit routine in LL31, and
\ shifts the result by the difference in the number of shifts, which acts as a
\ scale factor to get the correct result.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   K(3 2 1 0)          The result of the division
\
\   X                   X is preserved

\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   A = arctan(P / Q)
\
\ In other words, this finds the angle in the right-angled triangle where the
\ opposite side to angle A is length P and the adjacent side to angle A has
\ length Q, so:
\
\   tan(A) = P / Q
\
\ The result in A is an integer representing the angle in radians. The routine
\ returns values in the range 0 to 128, which covers 0 to 180 degrees (or 0 to
\ PI radians).

\
\ This routine twists the three 16-bit seeds in QQ15 once.
\
\ If we start with seeds s0, s1 and s2 and we want to work out their new values
\ after we perform a twist (let's call the new values s0´, s1´ and s2´), then:
\
\  s0´ = s1
\  s1´ = s2
\  s2´ = s0 + s1 + s2
\
\ So given an existing set of seeds in s0, s1 and s2, we can get the new values
\ s0´, s1´ and s2´ simply by doing the above sums. And if we want to do the
\ above in-place without creating three new s´ variables, then we can do the
\ following:
\
\  tmp = s0 + s1
\  s0 = s1
\  s1 = s2
\  s2 = tmp + s1
\
\ So this is what we do in this routine, where each seed is a 16-bit number.

\
\ Calculate system data from the seeds in QQ15 and store them in the relevant

\
\   QQ3 = economy (0-7)
\   QQ4 = government (0-7)
\   QQ5 = technology level (0-14)
\   QQ6 = population * 10 (1-71)
\   QQ7 = productivity (96-62480)
\
\ The ranges of the various values are shown in brackets. Note that the radius
\ and type of inhabitant are calculated on-the-fly in the TT25 routine when
\ the system data gets displayed, so they aren't calculated here.

\
\ Get a number from the keyboard, up to the maximum number in QQ25, for the
\ buying and selling of cargo and equipment.
\
\ Pressing "Y" will return the maximum number (i.e. buy/sell all items), while

\
\       Name: NWSHP
\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Universe
\    Summary: Add a new ship to our local bubble of universe
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This creates a new block of ship data in the K% workspace, allocates a new
\ block in the ship line heap at WP, adds the new ship's type into the first
\ empty slot in FRIN, and adds a pointer to the ship data into UNIV. If there
\ isn't enough free memory for the new ship, it isn't added.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   The type of the ship to add (see variable XX21 for a
\                       list of ship types)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the ship was successfully added, clear if it
\                       wasn't (as there wasn't enough free memory)
\
\   INF                 Points to the new ship's data block in K%

                        \ this, we need to loop through all the slots to look
                        \ for an empty one, so set a counter in X that starts

\  Deep dive: Extended screen coordinates
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Project the current ship's location or the planet onto the screen, either
\ returning the screen coordinates of the projection (if it's on-screen), or
\ returning an error via the C flag.
\
\ In this context, "on-screen" means that the point is projected into the
\ following range:
\
\   centre of screen - 1024 < x < centre of screen + 1024
\   centre of screen - 1024 < y < centre of screen + 1024
\
\ This is to cater for ships (and, more likely, planets and suns) whose centres
\ are off-screen but whose edges may still be visible.
\
\ The projection calculation is:
\
\   K3(1 0) = #X + x / z
\   K4(1 0) = #Y + y / z
\
\ where #X and #Y are the pixel x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the centre of

\             Drawing craters
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Draw an ellipse or half-ellipse, to be used for the planet's equator and
\ meridian (in which case we draw half an ellipse), or crater (in which case we
\ draw a full ellipse).
\
\ The ellipse is defined by a centre point, plus two conjugate radius vectors,
\ u and v, where:
\
\   u = [ u_x ]       v = [ v_x ]
\       [ u_y ]           [ v_y ]
\
\ The individual components of these 2D vectors (i.e. u_x, u_y etc.) are 16-bit
\ sign-magnitude numbers, where the high bytes contain only the sign bit (in
\ bit 7), with bits 0 to 6 being clear. This means that as we store u_x as
\ (XX16 K2), for example, we know that |u_x| = K2.
\
\ This routine calls BLINE to draw each line segment in the ellipse, passing the
\ coordinates as follows:
\
\   K6(1 0) = K3(1 0) + u_x * cos(CNT2) + v_x * sin(CNT2)
\
\   K6(3 2) = K4(1 0) - u_y * cos(CNT2) - v_y * sin(CNT2)
\
\ The y-coordinates are negated because BLINE expects pixel coordinates but the
\ u and v vectors are extracted from the orientation vector. The y-axis runs
\ in the opposite direction in 3D space to that on the screen, so we need to
\ negate the 3D space coordinates before we can combine them with the ellipse's
\ centre coordinates.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   K(1 0)              The planet's radius
\
\   K3(1 0)             The pixel x-coordinate of the centre of the ellipse

\

\                       just the sign of the sign-magnitude number
\
\   (XX16+1 K2+1)       The y-component of u (i.e. u_y), where XX16+1 contains

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This part draws the new sun. By the time we get to this point, the following
\ variables should have been set up by parts 1 and 2:
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   V                   As we draw lines for the new sun, V contains the
\                       vertical distance between the line we're drawing and the
\                       centre of the new sun. As we draw lines and move up the
\                       screen, we either decrement (bottom half) or increment
\                       (top half) this value. See the deep dive on "Drawing the
\                       sun" to see a diagram that shows V in action
\
\   V+1                 This determines which half of the new sun we are drawing
\                       as we work our way up the screen, line by line:
\
\                         * 0 means we are drawing the bottom half, so the lines
\                           get wider as we work our way up towards the centre,
\                           at which point we will move into the top half, and
\                           V+1 will switch to &FF
\
\                         * &FF means we are drawing the top half, so the lines
\                           get smaller as we work our way up, away from the
\                           centre
\
\   TGT                 The maximum y-coordinate of the new sun on-screen (i.e.
\                       the screen y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new
\                       sun)
\
\   CNT                 The fringe size of the new sun
\
\   K2(1 0)             The new sun's radius squared, i.e. K^2
\
\   Y                   The y-coordinate of the bottom row of the new sun

\ Calculate the following, with X determining the vector to use:

\
\ Although the code below supports a range of values of X, in practice the

\    Summary: Calculate CNT2 = arctan(P / A) / 4
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Calculate the following:
\
\   CNT2 = arctan(P / A) / 4
\
\ and do the following if nosev_z_hi >= 0:
\
\   CNT2 = CNT2 + 32
\
\ which is the equivalent of adding 180 degrees to the result (or PI radians),
\ as there are 64 segments in a full circle.
\
\ This routine is called with the following arguments when calculating the
\ equator and meridian for planets:
\
\   * A = roofv_z_hi, P = -nosev_z_hi
\
\   * A = sidev_z_hi, P = -nosev_z_hi
\
\ So it calculates the angle between the planet's orientation vectors, in the
\ z-axis.

                        \ to the destination, so we set it to 36 to start things
                        \ off, and will decrement Y for each byte we copy

 LDA (SC),Y             \ Fetch byte #36 of the source's ship data block at SC,

                        \ to go...

 LDA (SC),Y             \ Fetch byte #35 of the source's ship data block at SC,
 STA (INF),Y            \ and store it in byte #35 of the destination's block

 DEY                    \ Fetch byte #33 of the source ship, which is the
 LDA (SC),Y             \ low byte of the source ship's heap, and store in K

\
\ Specifically, this routine does the following:
\
\   * Reset the INWK ship workspace
\
\   * Set the ship to a fair distance away in all axes, in front of us but
\     randomly up or down, left or right
\
\   * Give the ship a 4% chance of having E.C.M.
\
\   * Set the ship to hostile, with AI enabled

\ contains the value of A returned by the previous call to DORND, this routine
\ does not necessarily set the new ship to a totally random location. See the

                        \

                        \
                        \   * LSR A would set the C flag to a random number to
                        \     give a range of 24 to 28, which would cover the
                        \     Cobra Mk III (pirate), Asp Mk II, Python (pirate),

\
\ This is the second half of the minimal game loop, which we iterate when we are
\ docked. This section covers the following:
\
\   * Process more key presses (red function keys, docked keys etc.)
\
\ It also supports joining the main loop with a key already "pressed", so we can
\ jump into the main game loop to perform a specific action. In practice, this
\ is used when we enter the docking bay in BAY to display Status Mode (red key

\
\ Work out how bad we are from the amount of contraband in our hold. The
\ formula is:
\
\   (slaves + narcotics) * 2 + firearms
\
\ so slaves and narcotics are twice as illegal as firearms. The value in FIST
\ (our legal status) is set to at least this value whenever we launch from a
\ space station, and a FIST of 50 or more gives us fugitive status, so leaving a
\ station carrying 25 tonnes of slaves/narcotics, or 50 tonnes of firearms
\ across multiple trips, is enough to make us a fugitive.

\    Summary: Normalise the three-coordinate vector in K3
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Normalise the vector in K3, which has 16-bit values and separate sign bits,
\ and store the normalised version in XX15 as a signed 8-bit vector.
\
\ A normalised vector (also known as a unit vector) has length 1, so this
\ routine takes an existing vector in K3 and scales it so the length of the
\ new vector is 1. This is used in two places: when drawing the compass, and
\ when applying AI tactics to ships.
\
\ We do this in two stages. This stage shifts the 16-bit vector coordinates in
\ K3 to the left as far as they will go without losing any bits off the end, so
\ we can then take the high bytes and use them as the most accurate 8-bit vector
\ to normalise. Then the next stage (in routine NORM) does the normalisation.

\
\   K3(5 4 3)           The 16-bit y-coordinate as (y_sign y_hi y_lo), where
\                       y_sign is just bit 7
\
\   K3(8 7 6)           The 16-bit z-coordinate as (z_sign z_hi z_lo), where
\                       z_sign is just bit 7

\    Summary: Toggle a configuration setting and emit a beep
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is called when the game is paused and a key is pressed that changes the
\ game's configuration.
\
\ Specifically, this routine toggles the configuration settings for the
\ following keys:
\
\   * CAPS LOCK toggles keyboard flight damping (0)
\   * A toggles keyboard auto-recentre (1)
\   * X toggles author names on start-up screen (2)
\   * F toggles flashing console bars (3)
\   * Y toggles reverse joystick Y channel (4)
\   * J toggles reverse both joystick channels (5)
\   * K toggles keyboard and joystick (6)
\
\ The numbers in brackets are the configuration options that we pass in Y. We
\ pass the ASCII code of the key that has been pressed in X, and the option to
\ check it against in Y, so this routine is typically called in a loop that
\ loops through the various configuration option.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:

\   X                   The ASCII code of the key that's been pressed
\
\   Y                   The number of the configuration option to check against
\                       from the list above (i.e. Y must be from 0 to 6)

\  Deep dive: Tidying orthonormal vectors

\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine orthonormalises the orientation vectors for a ship. This means
\ making the three orientation vectors orthogonal (perpendicular to each other),
\ and normal (so each of the vectors has length 1).
\
\ We do this because we use the small angle approximation to rotate these
\ vectors in space. It is not completely accurate, so the three vectors tend
\ to get stretched over time, so periodically we tidy the vectors with this
\ routine to ensure they remain as orthonormal as possible.

\ If A >= Q then 255 is returned and the C flag is set to indicate an overflow
\ (the C flag is clear if the division was a success).
\
\ The result is returned in one byte as the result of the division multiplied
\ by 256, so we can return fractional results using integers.
\
\ This routine uses the same logarithm algorithm that's documented in FMLTU,
\ except it subtracts the logarithm values, to do a division instead of a
\ multiplication.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if the answer is too big for one byte, clear if the
\                       division was a success
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   LL28+4              Skips the A >= Q check and always returns with C flag
\                       cleared, so this can be called if we know the division
\                       will work
\
\   LL31                Skips the A >= Q check and does not set the R counter,
\                       so this can be used for jumping straight into the
\                       division loop if R is already set to 254 and we know the
\                       division will work

\
\ This part sets up the visibility block in XX2 for a ship that is exploding.
\
\ The XX2 block consists of one byte for each face in the ship's blueprint,
\ which holds the visibility of that face. Because the ship is exploding, we
\ want to set all the faces to be visible. A value of 255 in the visibility
\ table means the face is visible, so the following code sets each face to 255
\ and then skips over the face visibility calculations that we would apply to a
\ non-exploding ship.

\
\ Visible edges are drawn using flicker-free animation, which erases the

\
\ Given a point (x1, y1), a gradient and a direction of slope, move the point
\ along the line until it is on-screen, so this effectively clips the (x1, y1)

\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine clips the line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2) so it fits on-screen, or

\ coordinates, and the clipped line is returned using 8-bit screen coordinates.

\ off-screen.

\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Drawing lines
\    Summary: Draw a ship line using flicker-free animation
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This routine implements flicker-free ship animation by erasing and redrawing
\ each individual line in the ship, rather than the approach in the other
\ Acornsoft versions of the game, which erase the entire existing ship before
\ drawing the new one.
\
\ Here's the new approach in this routine:
\
\   * Draw the new line
\
\   * Fetch the corresponding existing line (in position LSNUM) from the heap
\
\   * Store the new line in the heap at this position, replacing the old one
\
\   * If the existing line we just took from the heap is on-screen, erase it
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   LSNUM               The offset within the line heap where we add the new
\                       line's coordinates
\
\   X1                  The screen x-coordinate of the start of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   Y1                  The screen y-coordinate of the start of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   X2                  The screen x-coordinate of the end of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   Y2                  The screen y-coordinate of the end of the line to add
\                       to the ship line heap
\
\   XX19(1 0)           XX19(1 0) shares its location with INWK(34 33), which

\   Category: Moving
\    Summary: Calculate (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Add the signed delta (A R) to a ship's coordinate, along the axis given in X.
\ Mathematically speaking, this routine translates the ship along a single axis
\ by a signed delta. Taking the example of X = 0, the x-axis, it does the
\ following:
\
\   (x_sign x_hi x_lo) = (x_sign x_hi x_lo) + (A R)
\
\ (In practice, MVT1 is only ever called directly with A = 0 or 128, otherwise
\ it is always called via MVT-2, which clears A apart from the sign bit. The
\ routine is written to cope with a non-zero delta_hi, so it supports a full
\ 16-bit delta, but it appears that delta_hi is only ever used to hold the
\ sign of the delta.)
\
\ The comments below assume we are adding delta to the x-axis, though the axis
\ is determined by the value of X.
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   (A R)               The signed delta, so A = delta_hi and R = delta_lo
\
\   X                   Determines which coordinate axis of INWK to change:
\
\                         * X = 0 adds the delta to (x_lo, x_hi, x_sign)
\
\                         * X = 3 adds the delta to (y_lo, y_hi, y_sign)
\
\                         * X = 6 adds the delta to (z_lo, z_hi, z_sign)

\    Summary: Rotate the planet or sun's location in space by the amount of
\             pitch and roll of our ship
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ We implement this using the same equations as in part 5 of MVEIT, where we
\ rotated the current ship's location by our pitch and roll. Specifically, the
\ calculation is as follows:
\
\   1. K2 = y - alpha * x
\   2. z = z + beta * K2
\   3. y = K2 - beta * z
\   4. x = x + alpha * y
\
\ See the deep dive on "Rotating the universe" for more details on the above.

\       Name: TRTB%
\       Type: Variable
\   Category: Keyboard
\    Summary: Translation table from internal key number to ASCII
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ This is a copy of the keyboard translation table from the BBC Master's MOS
\ 3.20 ROM. The value at offset n is the upper-case ASCII value of the key with
\ internal key number n, so for example the value at offset &10 is &51, which is
\ 81, or ASCII "Q", so internal key number &10 is the key number of the "Q"
\ key.
\
\ Valid internal key numbers are Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) numbers in the range
\ &10 top &79, so they're in the ranges &10 to &19, then &20 to &29, then &30 to
\ &39, and so on. This means that the other locations - i.e. &1A to &1F, &2A to
\ &2F and so on - aren't used by the lookup table, but the MOS doesn't let this
\ space go to waste; instead, those gaps contain MOS code, which is replicated
\ below as the table contains a copy of this entire block of the MOS, not just
\ the table entries.
\
\ This table allows code running on the parasite to convert internal key numbers
\ into ASCII codes in an efficient way. Without this table we would have to do a
\ lookup from the table in the I/O processor's MOS ROM, which we would have to
\ access from across the Tube, and this would be a lot slower than doing a
\ simple table lookup in the parasite's user RAM.

# Fully buildable source code for Elite on the BBC Master 128

[BBC Micro (cassette)](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-beebasm) | [BBC Micro (disc)](https://github.com/markmoxon/disc-elite-beebasm) | [6502 Second Processor](https://github.com/markmoxon/6502sp-elite-beebasm) | **BBC Master 128**

This repository is a work in progress. When finished, it will contain fully documented source code for Elite on the BBC Master 128.

It is a companion to the [bbcelite.com website](https://www.bbcelite.com), which contains all the code from this repository, but laid out in a much more human-friendly fashion. The links above will take you to repositories for the other versions of Elite that are covered by this project.

## Acknowledgements

BBC Master Elite was written by Ian Bell and David Braben and is copyright &copy; Acornsoft 1986.

The code on this site has been disassembled from the version released on [Ian Bell's personal website](http://www.elitehomepage.org/).

The commentary is copyright &copy; Mark Moxon. Any misunderstandings or mistakes in the documentation are entirely my fault.

Huge thanks are due to the original authors for not only creating such an important piece of my childhood, but also for releasing the source code for us to play with; to Paul Brink for his annotated disassembly; and to Kieran Connell for his [BeebAsm version](https://github.com/kieranhj/elite-beebasm), which I forked as the original basis for this project. You can find more information about this project in the [accompanying website's project page](https://www.bbcelite.com/about_site/about_this_project.html).

The following archive from Ian Bell's site forms the basis for this project:

### A note on licences, copyright etc.

This repository is _not_ provided with a licence, and there is intentionally no `LICENSE` file provided.

According to [GitHub's licensing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository), this means that "the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work".

The reason for this is that my commentary is intertwined with the original Elite source code, and the original source code is copyright. The whole site is therefore covered by default copyright law, to ensure that this copyright is respected.

Under GitHub's rules, you have the right to read and fork this repository... but that's it. No other use is permitted, I'm afraid.

My hope is that the educational and non-profit intentions of this repository will enable it to stay hosted and available, but the original copyright holders do have the right to ask for it to be taken down, in which case I will comply without hesitation. I do hope, though, that along with the various other disassemblies and commentaries of this source, it will remain viable.

Right on, Commanders!
